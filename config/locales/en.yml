Verification is easy and provides information to owners to trust potentials renters. As an owner you give an item to another person for some time and you expect to receive your item in the same condition, Right? So, renters should have all the information possible to make owners comfortable in giving out their items, make friends and make also some extra cash! You need two verifications to get yourself verified member. First, you need to verify your mobile phone number we send back a code and you submit it into our system to check that it is you. So simple."
   popupstorz_intro2: "Extra verifications are also important. One type of extra verification is uploading a picture of you. It reaaaaally helps :). Think about renting and item but there are two options: The one owner has uploaded a picture and the other has not. (assuming all the rest verifications are the same as well as ratings), with whom are you more."
